# Notes 

# Assumptions
- Assumed first flight does not need to be from base (since endpoint base doesnt provide any information that matches the aircrafts endpoint origins).
- Assumed ident field is a unique id.
- Assumed pagination is not needed, as the api didnt respond to the offset and limit query parameters.
